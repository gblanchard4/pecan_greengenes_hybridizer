# Pecan GreenGenes Hybridizer
Combine [Pecan](http://ravel-lab.org/pecan/) and GreenGenes results for full lineage taxonomy. [Full taxonomy was not available for Pecan](https://github.com/pgajer/MCclassifier/issues/3) and had to be combined with GreenGenes results to achieve more information than just genus & species.

## Usage
```
pecan_greengenes_hybridizer.py -p pecan_taxa -g greengenes_taxa -o output
```
